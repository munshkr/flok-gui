# flok-gui

*Work in progress*: Soon there will be cross-platform binaries to download at
the [Releases page](https://github.com/munshkr/flok-gui/releases)


## Development

This repository is based on the `electron-webpack` template, that comes packed
with...

* Use of [`webpack-dev-server`](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server)
  for development
* HMR for both `renderer` and `main` processes
* Use of [`babel-preset-env`](https://github.com/babel/babel-preset-env) that
  is automatically configured based on your `electron` version
* Use of
  [`electron-builder`](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder)
  to package and build a distributable electron application

Make sure to check out [`electron-webpack`'s
documentation](https://webpack.electron.build/) for more details.
